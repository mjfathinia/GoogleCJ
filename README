Hello World!
Here you can find solutions for some of the Google Code Jam contests and problems. They are not best answers, but they all passed and received correct answer within time limit. There are no copyright on those items and you can use them in any way you want.
If you want some analysis/explanations about the code, have a look at my website: http://cheraq.com/
